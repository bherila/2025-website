## Transaction Import

The transaction import feature allows users to import transactions from a file. The import process is as follows:

1.  The user drops a file onto the import page.
2.  The frontend parses the file and determines the earliest and latest transaction dates.
3.  The frontend makes an API call to the backend to get all transactions for the account between these dates.
4.  The frontend performs duplicate detection on the client-side by comparing the imported transactions with the existing transactions.
5.  The frontend displays the imported transactions in a table, highlighting any duplicates.
6.  The user can then choose to import the new transactions.

## Duplicate Detection

Duplicate detection is performed on the client-side. A transaction is considered a duplicate if it has the same `t_date`, `t_type`, `t_description`, `t_qty`, and `t_amt` as an existing transaction. The comparison for `t_type` and `t_description` is a substring match.
