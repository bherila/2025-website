# Tax System

## Overview

The tax system tracks employment entities, links them to transaction tags and payslips, and generates tax-year summaries for Schedule C (self-employment), W-2, and investment income reporting. It also tracks marriage/filing status per year.

See `/database/schema/mysql-schema.sql` for the full database schema. Relevant tables:
- `fin_employment_entity` — W-2 jobs, Schedule C businesses, and hobbies
- `fin_account_tag` — transaction tags with optional `tax_characteristic` and `employment_entity_id`
- `fin_payslip` — payslips linked to employment entities
- `users.marriage_status_by_year` — JSON column with per-year filing status

---

## Employment Entities

Employment entities represent income sources and are stored in `fin_employment_entity`.

**Model**: `app/Models/FinanceTool/FinEmploymentEntity.php`

### Entity Types

| Type | Purpose | Links To |
|------|---------|----------|
| `sch_c` | Self-employment / sole proprietorship | Tags with Schedule C tax characteristics |
| `w2` | W-2 employer | Payslips; tags with W-2 tax characteristics |
| `hobby` | Hobby income (not subject to SE tax) | Tags (optional) |

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `display_name` | string | Human-readable name shown in the UI |
| `type` | enum | `sch_c`, `w2`, or `hobby`; immutable after creation |
| `start_date` | date | When the employment/business started |
| `end_date` | date\|null | When it ended (null if current) |
| `is_current` | boolean | Whether the entity is still active |
| `ein` | string\|null | Employer Identification Number |
| `address` | text\|null | Mailing address |
| `sic_code` | integer\|null | SIC code (Schedule C only) |
| `is_spouse` | boolean | Whether this entity belongs to the spouse |
| `is_hidden` | boolean | When `true`, the entity is excluded from all selection dropdowns but remains manageable in Settings |

### `is_hidden` Behaviour

When `is_hidden` is `true` for an entity:
- The entity **is excluded** from: payslip import dropdown, payslip detail form, tag editor entity selector, and any other picker that uses `?visible_only=true`.
- The entity **remains visible** in the Settings → Employment and Self-Employment table so it can be managed (edited or un-hidden).
- Hidden entities still appear on the Tax Preview page if they have tagged transactions or payslips.

API usage:
- Default (`GET /api/finance/employment-entities`) — returns **all** entities including hidden; used by the Settings page.
- With `?visible_only=true` — returns only non-hidden entities; used by payslip/tag dropdowns.

### Relationships

- `hasMany` → `FinAccountTag` (via `employment_entity_id`) — tags with entity-specific characteristics
- `hasMany` → `FinPayslips` (via `employment_entity_id`) — payslips from W-2 employers

### Security

- A global scope automatically filters by `auth()->id()`, ensuring users only see their own entities.
- The `creating` event auto-sets `user_id` from the authenticated user and prevents cross-user creation.

## Tag → Employment Entity Linking

Tags link to employment entities via `employment_entity_id` on `fin_account_tag`. The applicable characteristics depend on entity type:

- **Schedule C** (`sch_c`): `business_income`, `business_returns`, `sce_*`, `scho_*`
- **W-2** (`w2`): `w2_wages`, `w2_other_comp`
- **Other** (no entity): `interest`, `ordinary_dividend`, `qualified_dividend`, `other_ordinary_income`

The Tax Preview page groups Schedule C income/expenses by entity, generating separate Schedule C sections per business.

See [Tags.md](Tags.md) for the full list of tax characteristics and helpers.

---

## Payslip → Employment Entity Linking

Payslips (`fin_payslip` table) link to W-2 employment entities via `employment_entity_id`. This enables:
- Grouping payslips by employer for W-2 reconciliation
- Tracking gross pay, taxes withheld, and deductions per employer per year

---

## Marriage Status

Marriage/filing status is stored per year as a JSON column (`marriage_status_by_year`) on the `users` table. The UI shows all years from the earliest known year through the current year, with missing years defaulting to `false` (single/unmarried). Changes to individual years do not cascade to other years.

### API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/finance/marriage-status` | Get marriage status for all years |
| `POST` | `/api/finance/marriage-status` | Set status for a specific year (`{ year, is_married }`) |

---

## Tax Preview Page

**Routes**: `GET /finance/tax-preview` (canonical), `GET /finance/schedule-c` (301 redirect)
**Component**: `resources/js/components/finance/TaxPreviewPage.tsx` (orchestrator) + `ScheduleCPreview.tsx` (Schedule C section)
**Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/FinanceTool/FinanceScheduleCController.php`

### Sections (top to bottom)

1. **W-2 Income Summary** — Shown when a specific year is selected and payslips exist. Derives key W-2 line items (wages, bonus, RSU vesting, imputed income, federal/state tax withheld, OASDI, Medicare) from payslip records for the year. Populated from `/api/payslips?year=YYYY`.

2. **Federal Taxes** — Quarterly cumulative tax estimate table (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4). Income = W-2 payslip income + Schedule C net income (income − expenses − allowable home office). Reuses the `TotalsTable` component from the Payslips page via the `extraIncome` prop.

3. **California State Taxes** — Same as Federal Taxes but for CA state brackets.

4. **Schedule C Preview** (`ScheduleCPreview` component) — Transaction-tag-based Schedule C summary:
   - Ordinary Income (interest, dividends, other)
   - W-2 income tagged via transaction tags
   - Schedule C sections per entity (income / expenses / home office)
   - **"List transactions in-line" toggle** — when enabled, Schedule C cards expand to full container width (single column) so inline transaction rows are readable
   - Cards are always single-column on mobile/small screens (< md breakpoint)
   - All years loaded at once; year selector filters display client-side
   - `onScheduleCNetIncomeChange` callback emits net Schedule C income to the parent for tax table calculations

### API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/finance/schedule-c` | Tax data grouped by characteristic and year |
| `GET` | `/api/payslips?year=YYYY` | Payslip records for the year (W-2 summary and tax tables) |

---

## Employment Entity API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/finance/employment-entities` | List all entities (including hidden) — used by Settings page |
| `GET` | `/api/finance/employment-entities?visible_only=true` | List only non-hidden entities — used by payslip/tag dropdowns |
| `POST` | `/api/finance/employment-entities` | Create a new entity (`is_hidden` supported) |
| `PUT` | `/api/finance/employment-entities/{id}` | Update an entity (`is_hidden` supported) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/finance/employment-entities/{id}` | Delete an entity |

**Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/FinanceTool/FinanceEmploymentEntityController.php`

### Settings Page UX

- The Employment and Self-Employment table shows all entities including hidden ones.
- Hidden entities are visually dimmed and display a **Hidden** badge.
- Each row has only an **Edit** (pencil) icon — no delete icon on the row.
- The **Edit** modal includes an `is_hidden` toggle switch.
- The **Delete** button is inside the Edit modal footer (not on the table row) since deletion is uncommon. Clicking it closes the modal and opens a confirmation dialog.

## Seeder Data for Tax Preview Testing

The default `DatabaseSeeder` now runs `Database\Seeders\Finance\FinanceDemoDataSeeder` for `test@example.com`.
This includes:
- A Schedule C employment entity (`Blue Harbor Consulting`)
- A Schedule C tax-characterized tag (`sce_office_expenses`) linked to that entity
- Seeded transactions + tag mappings so Tax Preview has immediately testable data

This helps with local QA and screenshot generation for the Tax Preview and tags workflows.

Uses `HasFileStorage`, `SerializesDatesAsLocal`, and `SoftDeletes` traits.

Form type constants:
- `FORM_TYPES` — all valid form type strings
- `W2_FORM_TYPES` — `['w2', 'w2c']` (require `employment_entity_id`)
- `ACCOUNT_FORM_TYPES` — `['1099_int', '1099_int_c', '1099_div', '1099_div_c']` (require `account_id`)

### Controller: `App\Http\Controllers\FinanceTool\TaxDocumentController`

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
